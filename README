This is a basic client/server UDP Socket Programming example.

The idea is that the server will come up with a signle digit number
and the client has to guess what the number is.

Start the server program by passing the value of the port on which it will
accept inbound traffic and the value, that is tobe guessed.

Then activate the client program by passing in the IP Address of the server
and the port on which it is listening. There is an infinite loop running
in the client program. In every iteration the program will come up with a
random value and send that value to the server. On receiving the value, the
server will respond back saying whether the value is correct or not. If the value
is incorrect the programs will stop then and there by breaking off the loop. If not
then the loop continues.
